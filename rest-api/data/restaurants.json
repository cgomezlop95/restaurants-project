Yes, it still has all the hits — the kung pao pastrami, the thrice cooked bacon —but chef/proprietor Danny Bowien and executive chef Angela Dimayuga have also added a raw bar, two generous family-style set menus, and showstoppers like duck baked in clay. And you can still get a lot of food without breaking the bank."},{"name":"Morgan","date":"October 26, 2016","rating":4,"comments":"This place is a blast. Must orders: GREEN TEA NOODS, sounds gross (to me at least) but these were incredible!, Kung pao pastrami (but you already knew that), beef tartare was a fun appetizer that we decided to try, the spicy ma po tofu SUPER spicy but delicous, egg rolls and scallion pancake i could have passed on... I wish we would have gone with a larger group, so much more I would have liked to try!"},{"name":"Jason","date":"October 26, 2016","rating":3,"comments":"I was VERY excited to come here after seeing and hearing so many good things about this place. Having read much, I knew going into it that it was not going to be authentic Chinese. The place was edgy, had a punk rock throwback attitude, and generally delivered the desired atmosphere. Things went downhill from there though. The food was okay at best and the best qualities were easily overshadowed by what I believe to be poor decisions by the kitchen staff."},{"comments":"It was okay!","rating":3,"date":"18 de Abril de 2024","name":"user name to be updated"},{"name":"user name to be updated","date":"18 de Abril de 2024","comments":"I really liked it ! :)","rating":5}]},{"id":2,"name":"Emily","neighborhood":"Brooklyn","photograph":"2.jpg","address":"919 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11238","latlng":{"lat":40.4198,"lng":-3.7138},"image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/17/07/cd/40/the-colony-and-vodka.jpg","cuisine_type":"Pizza","operating_hours":{"Monday":"5:30 pm - 11:00 pm","Tuesday":"5:30 pm - 11:00 pm","Wednesday":"5:30 pm - 11:00 pm","Thursday":"5:30 pm - 11:00 pm","Friday":"5:30 pm - 11:00 pm","Saturday":"5:00 pm - 11:30 pm","Sunday":"12:00 pm - 3:00 pm, 5:00 pm - 11:00 pm"},"reviews":[{"name":"Steph","date":"October 26, 2016","rating":4,"comments":"Five star food, two star atmosphere.

We had the regular pork belly and a beef (forgot which cut) and a seafood tofu soup. Two meat and a soup was just prefect for the two of us. We could have done one meat and one soup. The portions of the meat are great! The beef was juicy, tender and so good. The sides were excellent. "},{"name":"Emily","date":"October 26, 2016","rating":2,"comments":"MEH.

It remains one of New York's — and the country's — essential Jewish delicatessens. Every inch of the massive Lower East Side space smells intensely of pastrami and rye loaves. The sandwiches are massive, so they are best when shared. Order at the counter, and don't forget to tip your slicer — your sandwich will be better for it."},{"name":"Allen","date":"October 26, 2016","rating":5,"comments":"If I lived in NY and got diabetes from eating here every single time I ate, I would do it over and over and over again just for that first bite.

Very trendy and hipsterish spot. Came here for lunch on a random weekday afternoon and when we arrived, there was a line forming already. The space is a bit cramped. You'll get to know your neighbors soon enough. The pizza is just delightful and delicious. It's a ncie plus that you get to see them firing up the pizzas in the corner. The major issue with Roberta's is the trek out to the Williamsburg/Bushwick."},{"name":"Laurel","date":"October 26, 2016","rating":4,"comments":"The pizza is fantastic, not THE best I've ever had, but would definitely go back since it has great food and great ambiance.
